# Metadata-correct
The initial purpose for metadata correct is to add metadata to pictures based on Json files, which are the biproduct of going through the Google Takeout. 
It will be able to handle files and organize them entirely on its own, and will eventually have a GUI and the ability to add info yourself.
There will be no need or ability to run it through commands as a user, in order to make this type of changes easy.

Metadata correct is written fully with Java Jackson and Apache Commons Imaging
